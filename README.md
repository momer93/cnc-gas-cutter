CNC gas cutter for low resource contexts

# Introduction

This cnc automated gas cutter was specifically designed for steel fabrication workshops in Oman as a proof of concept for my doctoral thesis, where i investigate the potential of self built low cost CNC automated machine tools for low  The design automates the hand held gas cutter torch that is often found in steel fabrication shops around the world. Gas cutting is different from plasma cutting in terms of the medium of cutting where a acetylene or propane flame is used to cut the metal. The process can cut only mild steel and not aluminium or stainless steel.

Frame Design
  
The machine was designed and implemented in Oman as part of my doctoral thesis, as a first proof of concept for the design of low cost and affordable open source machine tools for resource constrained contexts. The machine automates a typical gas cutting hand torch, but can also be adapted to use a machine torch or even a plasma cutter. The key features of the design are the metal frame system that utilizes simple square profile mild steel which is easily available in Oman. The linear rails are made of a combination of roller bearings running on bolts as axles, using the frame as part of the linear rail system.
